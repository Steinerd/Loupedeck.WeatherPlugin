# THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN ARCHIVED

I no longer have the interest or hardware to test/develop this plugin. 

I invite you to use https://github.com/yanus/LoupedeckWeatherPlugin instead

## Credits

This plugin is *heavily* influenced by [CZDanol/loupedeck-weatherwidget](https://github.com/CZDanol/loupedeck-weatherwidget). 
I personally couldn't get it to work consistantly and decided to create a smaller, leaner version of the same concepts.

# Installation

<details><summary><b>Loupedeck Installation</b></summary>
  
  
  1. Go to [latest release](https://github.com/Steinerd/Loupedeck.WeatherPlugin/releases/latest), and download the `lplug4` file to you computer
  1. Open (normally double-click) to install, the Loupedeck software should take care of the rest
  1. Restart Loupedeck (if not handled by the installer)
  1. In the Loupedeck interface, enable **Weather** by clicking <ins>Manage plugins</ins>
  1. Check the Weather box on to enable
  1. Drag the desired control onto your layout

Once click it will bring you to a dynamic playback device selection page.

<details><summary><b>IDE Installation</b></summary>
  Made with Visual Studio 2022, C# will likely only compile in VS2019 or greater. 

  Assuming Loupedeck is already installed on your machine, make sure you've stopped it before you debug the project. 

  Debugging _should_ build the solution, which will then output the DLL, config, and pdb into your `%LocalAppData%\Loupedeck\Plugins` directory.

  If all goes well, Loupedeck will then open and you can then debug.

# Usage

First, follow the __Loupedeck Installation__ instructions above. 

Then, to use inside the Loupedeck UI: 

1. Go to https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up and create a free account, if you don't have one already
1. Api Key can be created via https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
1. In the Loupedeck manager Click the [+] button on the same row as *Location* to add a location
1. Now comes the fun part... the value for this control is colon delimited; `postal_code,2_letter_iso_country_code:api_key:hide_name` (ex: `90210,us:98c98a0ba57d4a0a33e2a1d2d06ac365:true` to show weather for Beverly Hills **and** hide the name in the widget).<br/>
The last two steps are optional, hiding the location name is default to `true`
	1. Enter postal code and 2-letter ISO Country Code 
	1. :
	1. API Key
	1. : 
	1. true/false
1. Select Hook from the final dropdown and click Save

<details>summary><b>Advanced Users</b></summary>
I've added an additional nicety of having pressing the widget and having it open an application on the URL Protocol `weather:LocationQuery`.

So if you look in your registry `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\weather\shell\open\command` you'll see a crappy placeholder for a CMD prompt running weather.com passing in the first segment from the
the weather action configuration. 

You can replace it with your favorite browser explicitly with the `%1` being that location-query item. 

I personally replaced mine with the Win10 Weather App, `"C:\Windows\explorer.exe" shell:AppsFolder\Microsoft.BingWeather_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App`. 

You can also just drop the `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\weather` key if you don't want it to do anything for any of them
